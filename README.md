****Color Pattern Image Reader Project****

**Introduction**

This project focuses on developing software to interpret color patterns from images, inspired by the concept used in Lego's "Life of George" game. This game challenges players to recreate a displayed Lego block pattern and then use image processing to compare their creation with the original.

**Objective**

The software aims to read color pattern images from a hard disk and convert these images into an array representing the color pattern. This involves sophisticated image processing techniques, including pattern recognition and orientation analysis.

**Key Features**

Pattern Recognition: The software will identify and analyze color patterns from provided images.
Orientation Flexibility: It will handle images without a fixed orientation, accounting for possible flips in the pattern.
Edge Detection: Utilization of reference points (like black circles) in images for accurate edge detection.
